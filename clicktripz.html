</div>
		<div>Case Study:
Designing and Launching the AI-Powered Conversational Marketing Unit (Envoy).
</div>
		<div>branding 
</div>
		<div>As Product Designer, I led the end-to-end design of the new Envoy conversational marketing unit. In the idealization phase, I defined the product vision, integrating an initial DMO partner request for a display ad unit. Leveraging competitive analysis as my primary research, I informed initial user flows, interactions, and visual language. My design ensured the ad unit seamlessly fit within the fixed max height UI on both desktop and mobile. I then created detailed wireframes and prototypes.
</div>
		<div>After initial launch, the marketing team requested the addition of suggestion bubbles. Implemented without UX input, these additions led to a crowded design, and subsequent data showed low user interaction and a drop in overall engagement.
</div>
		<div>Envoy now successfully features numerous DMOs from around the world, showcasing its broad adoption and scalability.
</div>
		<div>V-3</div>
		<div>The business sought a new, high-value product: an AI-powered conversational unit to serve as a 'digital ambassador' for Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs). The core challenge was to conceptualize and design this entirely new product to engage travelers and drive meaningful conversions.
</div>
		<div>Global Adoption
</div>
		<div>My solution was to re-envision the UI layout entirely. I created a much cleaner, intuitive design that seamlessly integrated the suggestion bubbles, optimizing space and refining hierarchy to significantly improve user experience and performance.
I designed and prototyped this enhancement, collaborating closely with AI and engineering teams for its successful implementation.
</div>
		<div>My Role & Solution

		<div>V-2</div>
		<div>V-1
</div>
		<div>Higher CTR: Saw a significant uplift in Click-Through Rate from the unit to DMO websites.</div>
		<div>Reduced Support Inquiries: A reduction in direct support inquiries related to understanding the unit.</div>
		<div>Improved User Satisfaction: User testing revealed a notable improvement in perceived helpfulness and ease of use.</div>
		<div>Increased Conversation Completion: Achieved a notable increase in users completing full conversational flows.</div>

		<div>Let’s Test
</div>
		<div>A prime example was the Tab-unit, which began as a low-performing engineering prototype. </div>
		<div></div>
		<div>The Tab Unit
</div>
		<div>Case Study:
 Designing High-Impact Media Units for Enhanced User Experience.
</div>
		<div>A
</div>
		<div>I was able to initiate dedicated user research that challenged stakeholder assumptions. User testing showed that brand recognition and color drew users in, significantly increasing engagement, despite initial concerns that large logos would feel like banners. This key insight, combined with continuous A/B testing, allowed the design to evolve, transforming the Tab-unit into a high-performing product.
</div>
		<div>As a UX/UI Product Designer, I led the end-to-end design of various media units. My philosophy was to integrate these units seamlessly by analyzing existing performance data and publisher feedback.

</div>
		<div>I also designed a range of other products, from complex widgets and sleek Expedia-branded units to highly effective units as small as a button, all built on the same core principle of adding value.
</div>
		<div>B
</div>
		<div>The success of this small change, which more than doubled the initial click-through rate, validated the importance of product design and led to a more robust, research-driven process.

My design process was grounded in a blend of user testing, A/B and multivariate testing, and quantitative data analysis. This allowed me to gather qualitative insights from travelers, validate design hypotheses, and track user behavior to ensure every decision was data-driven.
</div>
		<div>V-1</div>
		<div>With a single design change—adding a subtle bounce animation to a directional arrow—I With limited engineering resources, my initial task was a single, high-impact change. My solution was to add a subtle bounce animation to a single directional arrow, a small but critical visual cue that guided the user from tab to tab.</div>
		<div>To combat "banner blindness," I was tasked with transforming space traditionally used for static banners into useful, native-feeling tools that would enhance the user's media experience and drive performance.</div>

As a UX/UI designer, I was a key contributor to the design team responsible for the core streaming experience. My work focused on improving key areas like Information Architecture and flow, while also helping to create a cohesive visual identity across all platforms. A key part of this process included brainstorming with the team, card sorting, and in-person user testing.

A prime example was redesigning the sign-up flows. I recommended an out-of-the-box approach: instead of listing features, I proposed a simple call to action to "unlock more for free." I validated this design through A/B testing, which proved this approach was more effective. I designed user flows that worked with the native experience of each platform, from Roku and Sony PlayStation to Xbox, Apple TV, and iOS.
